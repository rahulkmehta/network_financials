#### Notes:
> Phase 1 in progress â€” Tracking occupancy of a parking lot from a clean, sample image.
> Further notes: Improvements from baseline open-source include better black-white conversion, canny-edge detection done before houghline transformation, and automatic partitition within x-clusters (previously manual). For automatic clustering, I used 1D number array clustering through Jenks Natural Breaks Optimization
