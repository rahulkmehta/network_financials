1. Phase 1 in progress â€” Tracking occupancy of a parking lot from a singular clean, sample image.
2. Analysis of Work: Improvements from baseline open-sources include binary conversion of image (and gaussian smoothing) before Canny-Edge detection,a more robust houghline probabilistic transformation to support differences in lots in aerial imagery, and automated houghline transformation into x-clustering. For automatic x-clustering, average of houghlines x-coords (x1,x2) were  smoothed, plotted, and local maximas were taken to identify parking lanes. Despite differences in lots, bounding box creation stayed the same as from that height, the car1.h5 model is adequate in determining the approximate occupancy percentage even if the lines are a few pixels off.
3. Limitations of Phase 1: Region of interest was manually defined; otherwise, data became somewhat noisy for proper maxima analysis. Also, width of parking spots were manually defined (Reasoning in Point 2).
4. Two VGG16 models were used and compared, accuracy scores are in rccn.py and one was chosen for use.
