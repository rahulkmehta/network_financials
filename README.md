> Phase 1 in progress â€” Tracking occupancy of a parking lot from a clean, sample image.
> Analysis: Improvements from baseline open-sources include better binary conversion, canny-edge detection performed before houghlines, and automatic partitition within x-clusters (previously manual). For automatic clustering, mean-shift was used.
