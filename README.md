#### Notes:
> Phase 1 in progress â€” Tracking occupancy of a parking lot from a singular clean, sample image.
> Analysis of Work: Improvements from baseline open-sources include better binary conversion, canny-edge detection performed before houghlines, and automatic partitition within x-clusters (previously manual) among other things. For automatic clustering, average of houghlines (x1,x2) was smoothed, plotted, and local maximas were taken to simulate parking lanes
> Limitations of Phase 1: Region of Interest was manually defined; otherwise, data became too messy for proper maxima analysis.
