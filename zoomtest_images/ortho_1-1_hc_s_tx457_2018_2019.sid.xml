<abstract>
This data set contains imagery from the National
Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP 2018-2019).  The NAIP
acquires digital ortho imagery during the
agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S..
A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable
availability of ortho imagery within one year of
acquisition.  The NAIP provides two main products: 1
meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery
rectified to a horizontal accuracy within +/- 5 meters
of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from
the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP) or from the
National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP); 1 meter
or 60cm GSD ortho imagery rectified within +/- 6
meters to true ground.  The tiling format of NAIP imagery is
based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300
pixel buffer on all four sides.  The NAIP imagery is
formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North
American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).  The NAIP imagery may
contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.  This file
was generated by compressing NAIP imagery that covers
the county extent.  Two types of compression may be
used for NAIP imagery: MrSID and JPEG 2000. The target
value for the compression ratio is 15:1 for the 1 meter
imagery and 40:1 for the 60cm imagery.
</abstract>
<purpose>
The NAIP imagery is typically available for distribution
within 60 days of the end of a flying season and is intended
to provide current information of agricultural conditions
in support of USDA farm programs. For USDA Farm Service
Agency, the 1 meter and 60cm GSD product provides an
ortho image base for Common Land Unit boundaries and other
data sets.  The NAIP imagery is generally acquired in
projects covering full states in cooperation with state
government and other federal agencies who use the
imagery for a variety of purposes including land use
planning and natural resource assessment.  The NAIP is
also used for disaster response often providing the most
current pre-event imagery.

Digital imagery was collected at a nominal GSD of 80cm
or 40cm using nine Cessna 441 aircraft flying at
an average flight height of 8400m AGL for 80cm acquistion
and 4400m AGL for 40cm acquisition. Aircraft flew with
Leica Geosystem's ADS100/SH100 digital sensors with
firmware 4.54 or ADS100/SH120 digital sensors with
firmware 4.54. Each sensor collected 12 image bands
Red,Green,Blue and Near-infrared at each of three
look angles; Backward 19 degrees, Forward 26 degrees
and Nadir for the SH100.  Backward 10 degrees, Forward
14 degrees, and Nadir for the SH120. The Nadir Green
band was collected in high resolution mode effectively
doubling the resolution for that band.  The ADS100
spectral ranges are; Red 619-651nm,Green 525-585nm, Blue
435-495nm and Near-infrared at 808-882nm. The CCD arrays
have a pixel size of 5.0 microns in a 20000x1 format at
nadir; a 18000x1 format at the backward look angle
and a 16000x1 format at the forward look angle.
The CCD's have a dynamic range of 72db and the A/D
converters have a resolution of 14bits.  The ADS is
a push-broom sensor the ground footprint of the imagery
is approximately 8km wide at a nominal 40cm GSD and 16km
wide at a nominal 80cm GSD by the length flightline.
The maximum flightline length is limited to approximately
240km. The factory calibrations and IMU alignments for
each sensor (Serial Numbers: 10511,10512,10514,10522,
10527,10530,10531,10534,10540,10554,12502 ) were tested
and verified by in-situ test flights before the start
of the project. The Leica MissionPro Flight Planning
Software is used to develop the flight acquisition plans.
Flight acquisition sub blocks are designed first to
define the GNSS base station logistics, and to break
the project up into manageable acquisition units. The
flight acquisition sub blocks are designed based on
the specified acquisition season, native UTM zone of
the DOQQs, flight line length limitations (to ensure
sufficient performance of the IMU solution) as well
as air traffic restrictions in the area. Once the sub
blocks have been delineated they are brought into
MissionPro for flight line design. The design
parameters used in MissionPro will be 30% lateral
overlap and 40cm or 80cm resolution.  The flight lines
have been designed with a north/south orientation.
The design takes into account the latitude of the
state, which affects line spacing due to convergence
as well as the terrain. SRTM elevation data is
used in the MissionPro design to ensure the 50cm
GSD is achieved over all types of terrain.  The raw
data was downloaded from the sensors after each
flight using Leica XPro software. The imagery was
then georeferenced using the 200Hz GPS/INS data
creating an exterior orientation for each scan line
(x/y/z/o/p/k). Leica Xpro APM software was used to
automatically generate tiepoint measurements between
the foward, nadir and backward look angles for each line
and to tie all flight lines together. The resulting point
data and exterior orientation data were used to perform
a full bundle adjustment using ORIMA software. Blunders
were removed, and additional tie points measured in weak
areas to ensure a robust solution. Once the point data
was clean and point coverage was acceptable,
photo-identifiable GPS-surveyed ground control points
were introduced into the block adjustment. The bundle
adjustment process produces revised exterior orientation
data for the sensor with GPS/INS, datum, and sensor
calibration errors modeled and removed. Using the
revised exterior orientation from the bundle adjustment,
orthorectified image strips were created with Xpro
software and the June 2014 USGS 10m NED DEM. The Xpro
orthorectification software applies an atmospheric-BRDF
radiometric correction to the imagery. This correction
compensates for atmospheric absorption, solar
illumination angle and bi-directional reflectance. The
orthorectified strips were then overlaid with each other
and the ground control to check accuracy. Once the accuracy
of the orthorectified image strips were validated the
strips were then imported into Inpho's OrthoVista 7.0
package which was used for the final radiometric
balance, mosaic, and DOQQ sheet creation. The final
DOQQ sheets, with a 300m buffer and a ground pixel
resolution of 1m or 60cm were then combined and compressed
to create the county wide CCMs.
